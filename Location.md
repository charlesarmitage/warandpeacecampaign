I did have a list of names I'd come across in some of the fluff and books, I'll try and hunt it out.

I also created a couple of areas based on information I'd put together.

For example, I had heard mentioned the inner and outer trunk. I imagine the outer trunk to be the external walls of the hive, often punctuated with great gates to allow trade  between hives and passage into the ash wastes. The inner trunk I imagined to be the area surrounding the spike of core of magma that flows upwards into the hive. I imagined that the inner trunk would be lined with some kind of elevators, but called them Descenders (in my escher gangs backstory) these would be used to send juves/gangers/convicts whatever into the under hive. Calling them descenders implies that they may not be used to get back up.

The area that the eschers lived in was called the Kraken, so named because of a tangle of pipes taking magma from the core to a central processing unit. Looking like a giant octopus and tentacles.

They ran a pub there called the Last Gasp.

The settlement was on the edge of a place (found in the books) called Two Tunnels, which in the fluff is an escher controlled collapsed transit tube which links sumptown (also in the books) to the inner trunk, via the White wastes (in the books), which is an unstable collapsed dome.

How I see it is that the inner and outer trunk would be reasonably well populated, but as you get closer to the area in between, the population would thin due to lack of resources or proximity to settlements/trade routes to have better chances of survival.
